### Flutter Developer

<div align="left">

<p>
I enjoy building <strong>Flutter applications</strong> that don’t just work, but stay <strong>understandable</strong> and <strong>maintainable</strong> as they grow 🚀
</p>

<p>
Most of my time goes into thinking about <strong>structure</strong> how a feature should live in the app, how <strong>state is managed</strong> without leaking complexity, and how today’s decisions shape the code months later.
</p>

<p>
🌱 I’m currently deepening my understanding of <strong>advanced Flutter architecture</strong>, testing strategies and <strong>performance optimization</strong>, especially in production.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy collaborating on products where <strong>user experience</strong>, <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>clean code</strong> are treated as first-class concerns — not afterthoughts ✨
</p>

<p>
I’m especially interested in learning more about <strong>scaling Flutter apps</strong> and building <strong>reliable error-handling</strong> flows for real users, not just ideal scenarios.
</p>
